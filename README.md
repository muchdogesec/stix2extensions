# stix2extensions

## Overview

This repository is used to share custom STIX objects created by the threat intelligence community.

It is useful for two use-cases, for those who want to:

1. create their own custom STIX objects and make them easy to distribute
2. use the custom STIX objects created by others in this repo in a straight-forward way

## Structure of this repository

The key parts of this repository are structured as follows;

```txt
.
├── example_objects # example custom objects auto-generated by scripts in /generators/example_objects/
│   ├── properties
│   ├── sdos
│   └── scos
├── extension-definitions # the extension definitions auto-generated by /generators/extension-definition.py
│   ├── properties
│   ├── sdos
│   └── scos
├── generators # generates the extension definitions and example objects
│   ├── properties
│   ├── sdos
│   └── scos
├── schemas # the schemas references in each extension-definition object
│   ├── properties
│   ├── sdos
│   └── scos
└── remote-definitions # a collection of remote extension-definition objects not generated here
    ├── README.md # details source of extensions
    ├── x.json
    ├── y.json
    └── z.json
```

Each directory is structured by the STIX object type, either STIX Domain Objects (SDOs) or STIX Cyber Observable Objects (SDOs).

## Adding your own custom STIX objects to this repo

### Overview

First clone this repo, and set it up:

```shell
# clone the latest code
git clone https://github.com/muchdogesec/stix2extensions
# create a venv
cd stix2extensions
python3 -m venv stix2extensions-venv
source stix2extensions-venv/bin/activate
# install requirements
pip3 install .
```

To add your own objects to this repo you must then do the following things:

1. define a schema for it in the `schemas` directory.
2. create an entry for it in `stix2extensions` defining the properties
3. add an entry in `stix2extensions/_extensions.py` and `generators/extension-definition.py` to auto generate the Extension Definition for your objects. Then the script `python3 generators/extension-definition.py`
4. optional: add an entry under `generators/example_objects/` for your custom object. This script should generate a dummy object to show others what it looks like (this is more likely to increase adoption). Then run the script `generators/scos/*.py`.
5. optional: add an icon for your new object in our [stix2icons repository](https://github.com/muchdogesec/stix2icons). This will make it easy for graph viewers to render your object properly with an icon.

For each of these steps, you can see examples of the existing objects which you can use as templates.

Once done, you can then submit a PR to this repo and the DOGESEC team will check it looks good before merging it into the `main` branch so anyone can start using it.

### A note on generating the data

This script will generated the Extension Definition objects defining all of the custom objects in this repo (inc. any you've added at step 3);

```shell
python3 generators/smos/extension-definition.py
```

If you want to see example of how to use this script to generate the custom objects (and what they look like), you can run the generator scripts (created at step 4, don't forget to add yours);

```shell
python3 generators/sdos/*.py && \
python3 generators/scos/*.py && \
python3 generators/properties/*.py
```

#### A note about UUIDs in `generators`

Note, all of the SDO `id`s in this repo are generated by the namespace `1abb62b9-e513-5f55-8e73-8f6d7b55c237`. This is a randomly generated UUIDv4. It is used to ensure the objects generated by the code in this repo have persistent UUIDs on each update.

For all SCO object generation scripts we use the OASIS namespace `00abedb4-aa42-466c-9c01-fed23315a9b7`.

### Misc

Note, this repository also contains two scripts under `stix2extensions/tools`; 1) `creditcard2stix.py`, and 2) `crypto2stix.py`. These are utilities we use in our products.

You should use the core repositories for this data [creditcard2stix](https://github.com/muchdogesec/creditcard2stix) and [crypto2stix](https://github.com/muchdogesec/crypto2stix) respectively.

## Using the STIX objects defined in this repo

If you want to generate a custom STIX object found in this repo in your project (e.g. use the `cryptocurrency-transaction` STIX object to model crypto transactions in your research) you can import them like so:

```shell
pip3 install https://github.com/muchdogesec/stix2extensions/archive/main.zip
```

You can then easily use them in your code.

For example, here I am generating a `bank-account`;

```python
from stix2extensions import BankAccount

# define UUID for generating UUIDv5s -- this is the OASIS namespace for SCOs https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2/blob/master/stix2/base.py#L29

namespace=UUID("00abedb4-aa42-466c-9c01-fed23315a9b7")

# Create bank-account SCO

example_bankAccountSCO = BankAccount(
                    bank="Big Bank",
                    country="GBR",
                    currency="GBP",
                    holder_ref="identity--fb76b7b8-8701-5d8b-a143-0283847f6638",
                    iban="GB33BUKB20201555555555",
                    bic="DEMOGB22XXX",
                    )

print(example_bankAccountSCO)
```

Which prints the STIX object.

```json
{
    "type": "bank-account",
    "spec_version": "2.1",
    "id": "bank-account--a7348a10-f1b6-5b3d-8908-0ca0f67a5fb5",
    "country": "GBR",
    "currency": "GBP",
    "bank": "Big Bank",
    "holder_ref": "identity--fb76b7b8-8701-5d8b-a143-0283847f6638",
    "iban": "GB33BUKB20201555555555",
    "bic": "DEMOGB22XXX",
    "extensions": {
        "extension-definition--f19f3291-6a84-5674-b311-d75a925d5bd9": {
            "extension_type": "new-sco"
        }
    }
}
```
